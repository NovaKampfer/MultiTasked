Effective date: 2025-12-08

This Privacy Policy describes how MattBApps ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information when you use the MultiTasked application (the "App"). Please read this policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

If you do not agree with any part of this policy, do not use the App.

1. Data Controller / Contact Information
- Data Controller: Matthew Baerg
- App: MultiTasked
- Contact email: [baerg.matthew@gmail.com]

2. Types of Information We Collect
We collect two categories of information: Personal Data (information that can identify you) and Non-Personal/Usage Data.

2.1 Personal Data (may include)
- Account information you provide (name, email address) if the App provides sign-in or account features.
- Profile data you choose to store in the App (task titles, descriptions, due dates, notes, tags).
- Optional contact information you provide for sharing or collaboration features.

2.2 Non-Personal / Usage Data
- Device information (model, OS version, device identifiers).
- Log and diagnostic data (app version, crash reports, performance metrics).
- Analytics about app usage (feature usage, session length, user flows).
- Cookies or similar local storage if the App includes a web component.

3. How We Collect Information
- Information you provide directly: when you create an account, enter tasks or profile details, or contact support.
- Automatically: through analytics and diagnostics when you use the App.
- From third parties: if you sign in via third-party providers (e.g., Google, Apple), we may receive basic account information from that provider (subject to your consent and their terms).

4. Purposes for Collecting and Using Data
We use collected data to:
- Provide, operate, and maintain the App and its features.
- Store and synchronize your tasks and settings (if cloud sync is enabled).
- Improve and personalize the App experience.
- Diagnose and fix technical issues and crashes.
- Communicate with you about updates, security notices, or support requests (with your consent where required).
- Prevent abuse and enforce our terms of service.

5. Legal Basis for Processing (where applicable)
If you are in a jurisdiction (such as the EU) that requires a legal basis for processing personal data, we rely on:
- Your consent (for optional features like analytics or marketing communications).
- Performance of a contract (to provide requested services, e.g., account features or cloud sync).
- Legitimate interests (for app security, fraud prevention, and product improvement), balanced against your rights.

6. Sharing and Disclosure of Information
We do not sell personal information.

We may share information in the following limited circumstances:
- Service providers: third-party vendors who provide services such as analytics, crash reporting, cloud storage, authentication, and email — only as necessary to provide the service and under contract.
- Legal requirements: if required by law, subpoena, or similar legal process, or to protect rights, property, or safety.
- Business transfers: in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, user data may be transferred as part of that transaction (we will take steps to notify affected users where required).
- Aggregated or de-identified data: we may share or publish aggregated usage statistics that do not identify individual users.

Typical third-party services we may use (examples — replace with actual vendors if used):
- Analytics: e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase, Amplitude, Mixpanel
- Crash reporting: e.g., Sentry, Crashlytics
- Authentication / Sign-in: Google Sign-In, Sign in with Apple
- Cloud storage / sync (if provided): e.g., Firebase, AWS, or other providers

7. Data Retention
We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy, including for the purpose of complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. If you delete your account or request deletion, we will remove your personal data within a reasonable period, except to the extent we must retain it for legal or legitimate business purposes.

8. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the security of your information, including industry-standard technical and organizational safeguards. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. You acknowledge the inherent risks in transmitting data online and that we cannot guarantee absolute security.

9. Data Transfers / International Processing
Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. When we transfer personal data across borders, we rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) where required by law.

10. Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have collected a child’s personal information without parental consent, we will take steps to delete it.

11. Your Privacy Rights (where applicable)
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:
- Access the personal data we hold about you.
- Correct or update inaccurate or incomplete data.
- Delete your personal data (subject to exceptions).
- Restrict or object to certain processing.
- Port your data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
- Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.
- Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

To exercise these rights, contact us at the email address above. We may require verification before fulfilling requests.

12. Choices and Controls
- Account settings: you can review and edit certain account information within the App.
- Marketing communications: you can opt out of promotional emails by following unsubscribe links or contacting us.
- Analytics and cookies: if the App offers an opt-out for analytics, you can disable it in settings (or uninstall the App to stop data collection).

13. Third-Party Links and Services
The App may contain links to third-party websites or services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy notices of any external services you use.

14. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the Effective Date above. If we make material changes, we will provide more prominent notice (for example, in-app notification or email) where required.

15. Additional Notices (if applicable)
- If the App uses cloud sync or server-side storage, include a brief description of what is synced and where.
- If you integrate any payment, advertising, or social features, list the relevant data flows and vendors.
